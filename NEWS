Release 0.2.0.0, April 2, 2012
Changes since release 0.1.0.0:

* Henceforth all public releases will have only even numbers in their
  release numbers (e.g. 0.2.0.0, 0.2.0.2, etc.) If a release has any
  odd numbers in its version, it is a development release.

* QuickCheck tests are removed. Eventually I will reimplement these in
  a separate library package.

* Added Feed function to System.Console.MultiArg.Prim; this allows you
  to carry out stateful parses without using a user state. Sometimes
  this aids in composability--for instance, I use it when combining
  parsers from different parts of the same program.
