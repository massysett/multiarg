This is multiarg, a library of combinators to parse command lines.

Since you are reading this you are examining the source code
which is kept in Git. This code is "pre-release," meaning that although
the "released" code has zero warranty, this code has negative
warranty :) However I try to keep the "master" branch in an always
working state.

For "released" code see Hackage:
