* remove the option that is returned in the tuple from combinators
   like longOneArg. Not sure why they were here. Needed for "mixed"
   functions but not for these. (Update - these need to be here, for
   instance when using <|>. Add note in comments.)

* Redo QuickCheck tests. Test parsers and combinators, and test a
   complete parser.

* Add comment to Combinators - parsers do not consume any input if
   option is not matched.

* Examine how errors are handled?
